This project requires multiples lybraries that are not installed by default : pygame, pygame_widgets, numpy, numba.
You can import them using pip (for example 'pip install pygame')
To download the project you can do it either with git (git clone -b main https://github.com/Heros38/Sandbox.git) or by downloading the zip file.

To run the sandbox, just run the main.py file, you can mess around with settings in the config.py file.

Controls :
  * LMB to place element
  * RMB to replace by air

Don't use the experimental version (it requires a c compiler and knowledge about the project + it's not up to date).

The rust version will probably replace the python version in the future, but it's not at that point yet.

Have fun !
