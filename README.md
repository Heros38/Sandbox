This project requires multiples lybraries that are not installed by default : pygame, pygame_widgets, numpy, numba.
You can import them using pip (for example 'pip install pygame')

To run the sandbox, just run the main.py file, you can mess around with settings in the config.py file.

Controls :
  * LMB to place element
  * RMB to replace by air

I might add a more detailed explanation later.
